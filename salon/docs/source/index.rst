**This website we have developed is basically a booking site for barbers. We aimed to ensure the best coordination between the customer, the barber and the shop owner.**

**On the homepage of the site, general information about the barbers and links to booking are available. There is also a blog on our site where users can express their opinions. On the Campaigns page, users can follow the opportunities related to the barber shops. In addition, users must be logged in to use some features. On the Profile page, all users can register their credit cards. Shop owners can create their own shops and register barbers working in the shop. In addition, there is an admin panel that only the admin can access.**
